# 3p5 programming language

Python like programming language

## Evaluation Criteria

* [x] Named variables (`let`)
* [x] Recursion
* [ ] Lazy evaluation
* [x] Functions
* [ ] Closures
* [x] IO operations
* [x] Lists / Sequences
* [x] Library functions: lists/sequences

## Step-by-step progress:

- Stage 1: Develop an abstract syntax tree and parser for your language + one example program.
- Stage 2: Develop an interpreter/compiler for your language.
- Stage 3: Write example programs and documentation.

I made a pull request for each stage, including all the key features of the language.
